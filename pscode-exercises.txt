// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a=1
b=2
sum=3

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

take Number
remainder=Number%2
if remainder==0;
 print even
else
 print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

input n1, n2, n3, n4, n5
avg = (n1,n2,n3,n4,n5)/5
small = n1
large = n1
for i = 2 to 5
 if n1> ni then:
 small = ni
if n1 < ni: then:
large = ni
print("Average:", avg)
print("Smallest:", small)
print("Largest:", large)
